## Objective is to create a CFB playoff system that:
    1. Doesn't devalue conference champions
    2. Doesn't punish conference runner-ups so much
    3. Takes SOS into account
    4. Gives G6 teams a chance
        a. Doesn't replace worthy P4 teams
        b. Very limited automatic qualifying
    5. Rewards teams for going undefeated/winning conference with byes
    6. Deals with Notre Dame fairly
    7. Punishes worse playoff teams with more games/play-ins
    * How many teams? 16 or 24 would be ideal
    ** Play-ins? 

## Simulation system takes into account:
    1. Total offense
    2. Turnover margin
    3. SOS
    4. Defense strength
    5. Home-field advantage
    6. Prestige (teams that have been there, done that tend to do better in playoff situations)
    7. Degree of "luck" (i.e. trick plays, freak turnovers, injuries, 4th down conversions, errors)
    8. RNG to take into account "team attitude"
        a. Strong P4 teams playing against G6 teams sometimes look forward to the next week
        b. G6 teams can be intimidated by strong, prestigious P4 teams
        c. Vice-versa for both above - hence RNG
    *** 7 & 8 should have little effect compared to 1-5. 6 should have less than 1-5 but more than 7-8
